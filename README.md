# TouchPoint.js

A tiny (3.6kb minified) vanilla JavaScript library made for in-browser HTML prototyping (as part of the UX process) that visually shows where the user clicks/taps on-screen using CSS3 transforms and transitions. TouchPoint is highly customizable, mobile ready and great for screencasting, screen recording, user testing and presentations.

**Live Demo: [View](http://lighthouseux.com/in-the-lab/lib/touchpoint-js/demo.html)**

## Installation
Download and include `touchpoint.js` or `touchpoint.min.js` in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` (recommended) in your HTML document. There are no dependencies:

```html
<script src="touchpoint.min.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start/How to Use
After you load the script you simply initialize TouchPoint and add an event listener to whichever DOM element you want TouchPoint to show over: 

```html
<script>
	TouchPoint.init(window);
</script>
```

**That's it!**

## Options
TouchPoint is customizable. There are a number of options that you have access to to customize the look for your needs. It's important that these options be defined before you initialize TouchPoint with `TouchPoint.init()`. Otherwise, your updates won't show.

#### Color
Change the default color of TouchPoint. Any valid CSS color can be used. 

Default value: `'#FFF'`
```html
TouchPoint.color = 'red';
```

#### DOM
Change the default DOM element that TouchPoint will be active over. Any valid selector can be used: element name, CSS class or ID. If you want TouchPoint to only show on a specific element, make sure that that element is set to `overflow: visible`, otherwise TouchPoint will get clipped.

Default value: `window`
```html
TouchPoint.dom = elementVarId;
```

or (recommended)

```html
TouchPoint.init(elementVarId);
```

#### Element
Change the kind of HTML element that TouchPoint creates. 

Default value: `'div'`
```html
TouchPoint.el = 'span';
```

#### Opacity
Change the opacity of the TouchPoint. You can use any value between `0` and `1`. 

Default value: `0.8`
```html
TouchPoint.opacity = 0.5;
```

#### Scale
Change the final scale of the TouchPoint. This value can range from `0` and beyond. 

Default value: `8`
```html
TouchPoint.scale = 14;
```

#### Size
Change the initial size of the TouchPoint. This value is `px`. 

Default value: `20`
```html
TouchPoint.size = 5;
```

#### zIndex
Change the zIndex of the TouchPoint. By default it's set at the highest `z-index` depth possible, but you may find the need to change it based on your own prototype. 

Default value: `9999`
```html
TouchPoint.z = 500;
```

## Performance
Performance should not be an issue because each individual TouchPoint element is dynamically created and then automatically removed from the DOM after being used. 

The animation is handled via the `requestAnimationFrame` function that is available in all current browsers. This has better overall performance than using `setTimeout`, which doesn't redraw consistently.
